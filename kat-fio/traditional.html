            <h1>Traditional Art</h1>
            <p>Recently I have been learning how to paint using gouache, which is a water-based acrylic paint. It has the consistency of watercolor and the vibrant colors of acrylic. Color theory is a challenge for me so I’ve been working on incorporating it more into my work so that I can get better. Practice makes progress!
                I take a lot of inspiration from nature, so artists like Beatrix Potter and Van Gogh have always been artists that I admire. As you’ve probably noticed is that I also like a hint of spookiness in my art. I can only thank Tim Burton for that dark and whimsy twist. 
                I also wanted to include some of my embroidery and crochet final products. Anything, where I get to work with my hands, fascinates me.
                </p>
