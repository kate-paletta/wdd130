            <p>Welcome! My name is Kate Paletta. I’m a self-taught artist, and I’ve been creative my whole life. Nothing brings me more joy than when I get to create something new and beautiful. That’s why I’m so happy to share this website and my art with you.
            I remember being five years old drawing a stick figure and being so proud of myself, and thinking ‘What a good artist I am!’. Luckily that childish pride grew into a passion Where I have poured my time and effort to learn everything I can about creating art. On my website, you can peruse my traditional works with pencil and paint as well as the works that I created digitally.
            </p>
