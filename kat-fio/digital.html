            <h2>Digital Art</h2>
            <p>A recent passion project with my digital work has been making phone wallpapers. Examples of those are the mountain sunrise, moon, and scripture quote. I work mainly in  Adobe Photoshop but have used the popular application Procreate. There are many fun uses for digital art. One of them is stickers. My Eowyn piece was created to be used as a sticker, and I have one on my laptop. One of the things that I like about creating art digitally is all the different effects I can create. Iâ€™m particularly fond of how my mossy reaper piece looks with fog and soft moss look that I was able to create with different brush textures and changing opacity. There is always something new to learn when you create art digitally.</p>
